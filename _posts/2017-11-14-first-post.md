This website is created on November 14, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia.

It is designed/written by myself while I am preparing the final exams of my last semester at Georgia Tech. Trying not to be worried because I believe that a bright future awaits me.

It's pretty empty now but I will try to add more of my adventures here.
